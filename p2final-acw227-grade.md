# Planning - **( [20] | [18] /20)**

## (10 Points Total): Explanation of Persona & Design Process (this includes Persona, Sketches, and Wireframes)

### Persona: ( 3 Points )
*The description of the persona must mention the rationale behind the decision for using the persona, as well as how this persona will affect the design of the website*
*Here are a few examples of what we expect:*

* *ex) “I chose Abby because she is not tech-savvy; as a result the design should be simple*
  * *The design decisions coming from Abby are too vague. How do you aim to make it simple? What part of the design should be simple?*
  * *This may lead to reduced points*
* *ex) “I chose Abby because she is not tech savvy; therefore the design should be simplified so that the database visualization should be easy to read through by anybody who is not tech-savvy”*
  * *Clear reasoning how Abby affects design decisions*
  * *Take note they mention particular parts of design (“database visualization”) and/or how those particular parts should appear to be (“should be easy to read by anybody who is not tech-savvy”)*
  * *This would be a strong candidate for full points*

> [Grader 1] | [Grader 2]  
> [ ] | [ ] (0/3): No mention of their persona  
> [ ] | [ ] (2/3): Mentioned persona and reasoning, but no clear connection between their choice in persona and how persona affects design decisions.   
> [3] | [3] (3/3): Mentioned persona and reasoning, student mentions adequately how persona choice will affect design decisions.

###  Sketches: ( 2 Points )
*Sketches must display idea variation, evidence of the design process, or both.*

> [Grader 1] | [Grader 2]  
> [ ] | [ ] (0/2): No sketches at all   
> [ ] | [ ] (1/2): Submitted, but hard to determine design mentality from sketch  
> [2] | [2] (2/2): Submitted, shows variety in idea generation in sketch or can determine design mentality from sketch

### Wireframes: ( 5 Points )
*Wireframes must be close to an actual depiction of their website. Placeholders must be few and far between, and design principles must be considered when drawing Wireframes.*

> [Grader 1] | [Grader 2]  
> [ ] | [ ] (0/5): No wireframes at all   
> [ ] | [ ] (2/5): Wireframes submitted, but lacking in content examples (i.e. many placeholders) or design principles (i.e. margins, padding, organization)  
> [ ] | [ ] (4/5): Submitted, made an attempt to showcase a complete visualization but may be vague or lack content in important areas (i.e. navigation bar), somewhat improper spacing of elements   
> [5] | [5] (5/5): Submitted, shows attention to detail and design principles, content is not placeholder content

## ( 10 Points Total ): Database Planning

### Catalog Description: ( 2 Points )
*Their catalog description should have the following criteria:*
  * *Reasoning behind catalog (They creating a catalog for ___?)*
  * *What are the fields (aka Columns) that their catalog will use?*

> [ ] | [ ] (1/2): One of the two criteria above followed, but not the other  
> [2] | [2] (2/2): Both criteria above followed

### Database Schema: ( 3 points )
*Their database schema plan should have the following criteria:*
  * *How many tables will they have? (they need at least 1)*
  * *What columns/fields will they have in their table(s)? (they need at least 4 columns/fields)*
  * *What type will each column/field be? What constraints will their fields have? (primary key, not null, autoincrement, etc.)*

> [Grader 1] | [Grader 2]  
> [ ] | [ ] (0/3): No database schema given   
> [ ] | [ ] (1/3): Only 1 of the 3 above followed   
> [ ] | [2] (2/3): Only 2 of the 3 above followed   
> [3] | [ ] (3/3): At least one table mentioned; fields are detailed with their constraints and types

### Database Query Plan: ( 3 points )
*Their database query plan MUST mention 3 database queries:*
  * *One to retrieve all results*
  * *One to search results by specific field.*
  * *One to insert into database.*
*Students can use natural language, pseudocode, or the SQL queries themselves to describe it, but they have to mention the 3 queries*

> [Grader 1] | [Grader 2]  
> [ ] | [ ] (0/3): No database queries mentioned at all   
> [ ] | [ ] (1/3): Only one database queries mentioned and is sensible (reasonably correct)   
> [ ] | [ ] (2/3): Two database queries mentioned and are sensible (reasonably correct)   
> [3] | [3] (3/3): All 3 database queries mentioned and are sensible (reasonably correct)

### Filtering Inputs and Escaping Outputs: ( 2 points )
*This part of their plan must follow the following criteria:*
  * *A description of how they check user input and how they determine which data is valid.*
  * *A justification of why they allow some types of data and not others.*
    * *What type of data did they check for in each field/category/filter and why?*
    * *Do they allow special characters (\$, \# , !) for entry names? Why?*
    * *Do they allow alphabetic characters in their date fields? Why?*
    * *Do they allow duplicate entries? Why?*
  * *What values will they escape and what methods will they use?*
  * *Don't forget about contexts (HTML vs. SQL).*
*Students can use natural language, pseudocode, or HTML/PHP code themselves to describe it*

> [Grader 1] | [Grader 2]  
> [ ] | [ ] (0/2): No adequate mention of how they will check/validate user input and escape output   
> [ ] | [1] (1/2): Student has mentioned how they will check/validate user input and/or will escape output, but their description lacks vital details   
> [2] | [ ] (2/2): Student has mentioned all of the above with clarity

# Comments

**Grader 1 TA Comments**
Great job! Your site is well designed and your add form and search function well.
- Neither of your pages validate. Please check this on w3schools.
- You do not give messages for incorrect data types.

**Grader 2 TA Comments**  
_Grader 2 TA Comments_
* (-1pt) Database Schema Design does not mention any constraints for columns (PK, NOT NULL, AUTOINCREMENT, etc)
* (-1pt) Filter Input Escape Output Plan- FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING is a method to filter input, should be escaping output with htmlspecialchars()
* (-3pts) Scrolling not enabled on search page- cannot see all search results
* (-2pts) canoes.php and search.php does not validates
* Overall, great job! Be sure to validate your site before submitting. Nice clean design.
